                <h2>What is the difference between Sadness and Depression?</h2>
                <p>
                    Sadness is a human emotion that all people feel at certain times
                    during their lives. Feeling sad is a natural reaction to situations that
                    cause emotional upset or pain. There are varying degrees of sadness.
                    But like other emotions, sadness is temporary and fades with time.
                    In this way, sadness differs from depression.

            <h2>Symptoms of Depression</h2>
            <p>
                When you’re sad, it may feel all-encompassing at times. 
                But you should also have moments when you are able to laugh 
                or be comforted. Depression differs from sadness. 
                The feelings you have will affect all aspects of your life. 
                It may be hard or even impossible to find enjoyment in anything, 
                including activities and people you used to enjoy. 
                Depression is a mental illness, not an emotion. <u>Symptoms include:</u>

            <h2>What is the purpose of sadness?</h2>
            <p>The foundational human emotions include 
                joy, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise. 
                Sadness belongs on this list, too. 
                It may not feel like positive emotion, 
                but there are some surprising benefits of sadness:</p>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>It helps us feel strong in the face of adversity</b></li>
                <p>Even the fiercest fighters know how important rest is, 
                    and sadness lets us do just that. When we’re feeling sad, 
                    we might feel tired, sluggish, and less receptive to the world. 
                    But what are our body and our mind telling us? To regain our strength.
                    By giving ourselves the permission to feel sadness, we’re actually regaining our strength.</p>
                <li><b>It forces us to confront what’s happening to us</b></li>
                <p>When we’re sad, we look inward to identify what’s bothering, 
                    hurting, or angering us. When we know what’s hurting us, 
                    we can start healing.</p>
                <li><b>It tells others we need help</b></li>
                <p>When we’re sad, we can’t help it. We wear it on our sleeves. 
                    Showing our emotions can help signal that we need support. 
                    And for your support system, it’s important they’re attuned 
                    to your emotions. That way, other people that we’re going 
                    through something and may need their help.</p>
                <li><b>It reminds us of life’s meaning</b></li>
                <p>Sadness acknowledges the special role of things in our lives. 
                    If we’re sad about a fight with a friend, it’s because that 
                    person is important to us. If we’re sad that we didn’t get a 
                    job we applied for, it’s because we care about our career development.
                    In a lot of ways, sadness reminds us of our personal values, 
                    our purpose, and our passions.</p>
                <li><b>It teaches us to adapt</b></li>
                <p>Life is full of things we can’t avoid. 
                    But sadness is a great teacher. 
                    What makes us sad now might not be so hard later 
                    because we’ve learned to adapt and be resilient.</p>
                <li><b>It connects us with others</b></li>
                <p>Sadness is a vulnerable emotional state. 
                    But when we share it with others, 
                    we form bonds by invoking their empathy.</p>
