                <h2>What is the difference between Sadness and Depression?</h2>
                <p>
                    Sadness is a human emotion that all 
                    people feel at certain times
                    during their lives. Feeling sad is 
                    a natural reaction to situations that
                    cause emotional upset or pain. 
                    There are varying degrees of sadness.
                    But like other emotions, 
                    sadness is temporary and fades with time.
                    In this way, sadness differs from depression.
